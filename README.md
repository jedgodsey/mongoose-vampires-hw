# Hungry for more

1. Make an index route that will `res.send()` (or even better--`res.json()`--look it up!) the json of all the data in our database.

2. If number 1 was easy, try to connect your database to your application and show a proper index page that displays your vampire data. If this is also easy, create a show page as well where you are showing individual vampire data.

3. Have extra time? Try out a few more problems on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
